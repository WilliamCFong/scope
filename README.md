# skope
**S**ynthetic ***K**2* **O**bjects for **P**LD **E**xperimentation

**skope** allows the creation of synthetic *K2* light curves to test de-trending methods. As *Kepler* runs out of fuel, telescope motion will increase in magnitude and become less predictable. **skope** simulates targets traversing the CCD with high motion, allowing the characterization of high-motion cases.

Note that **skope** depends on the **EVEREST** pipeline (Luger et. al). **EVEREST** can be installed with:
<pre><code>pip install everest-pipeline</code></pre>
